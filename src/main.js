// js13kGames 2026 - stationary first-person roguelike wave shooter.
//
// Build order (DESIGN.md 15) steps 1-9: the renderer, the core loop, the rainbow
// bind, the minimap and HUD, the five ghost types, the waves and their threat
// budget, the upgrade cards, and the sound. What is left is step 10, the ship
// pass, and the particles.
//
// CONVENTIONS, fixed here once because everything downstream depends on them:
//
//   +x right, +y DOWN, +z forward (away from the camera).
//   y-down is not a preference. DESIGN.md 5 specifies `py = y*s + h/2`, and that
//   formula only puts a model the right way up if world y already points down.
//
//   The camera sits at the origin and never translates (DESIGN.md 5). It only
//   rotates: yaw right-positive, pitch up-positive.
//
//   World units are metres. F is the focal length in metres and PX converts
//   metres to pixels, so the same scene frames identically at any window size -
//   that scale factor is the only thing added to the spec's projection.

const { min, max, abs, cos, sin, tan, atan2, hypot, random, round, floor, PI } = Math;

export const C = {
  // --- Projection ------------------------------------------------------------
  _F: 1.2,             // focal length, metres. With ZOOM this sets the field of
                      // view: tan(halfFOV) = W / (2 * PX * F), about 73 degrees
                      // horizontal at 16:9.
  _ZOOM: 1,            // metres-to-pixels is ZOOM * screen height
  _NEAR: 0.05,         // metres. Anything nearer is dropped rather than clipped.

  // --- Flat shading (DESIGN.md 5: three discrete steps, no gradients) --------
  _LGT: [-0.42, -0.80, 0.43],   // above-front-left. -y is up, so this points down.
  _T0: 0.18,           // dot thresholds between the three steps
  _T1: 0.62,
  _STEP: [0.42, 0.70, 1],       // and the three brightnesses they select

  // --- Camera (DESIGN.md 12) -------------------------------------------------
  // Sensitivity as a fraction of the SCREEN, not a number of pixels. One drag
  // from edge to edge turns you SWEEP half-turns, so two sweeps is all the way
  // round and it is the same gesture on any display - at a fixed rate per pixel
  // it was two sweeps at 1500px wide and nearly three at 1080p.
  _SWEEP: 1,           // half-turns per full drag across the window
                      // turning against 360 degrees of threat is the whole
                      // tension, and fast turning throws it away.
  // Radians up and down. Swept rather than guessed: for every ghost type at
  // every range, which pitches actually put the crosshair on it. The answer is
  // that they all straddle level - ghosts float 0.15m under the eye and most of
  // them are far away - so a Drifter at 16m is targeted between -1.7 and +0.6
  // degrees, and a Hulk at 3m, the widest thing at any sane range, between -17.8
  // and +12.0. Nothing becomes unreachable until the stop is inside 9 degrees.
  //
  // So the cap is not about reach, it is about travel: at 0.55 a drag could
  // point 31 degrees either way, and everything past about 18 was empty sky and
  // bare ground. 0.30 is 17.2 degrees, which still crosses the whole of what a
  // Hulk at 3m offers and leaves the close-range bands - a Hulk at 1.5m runs to
  // -34 - overlapping it many times over. Half the range it started with, and
  // none of the aiming.

  // The time of day, and it runs down over a run. Two palettes and a blend
  // between them rather than one palette a stop: measured, two-and-a-blend costs
  // 61 bytes against 113 for six stops, because the cost is the DATA and six
  // palettes is three times as much of it. The blend can be quantised into steps
  // for the same 61 if a hard change per five waves ever reads better.
  //
  // Each row is skyTop, skyHorizon, groundFar, groundNear, horizonLine.
  _ENV0: [[46, 20, 74], [130, 42, 70], [40, 33, 30], [84, 70, 56], [150, 80, 80]],
  _ENV1: [[3, 4, 9], [8, 8, 18], [7, 7, 10], [16, 15, 18], [27, 32, 54]],
  _ENVW: 30,          // the wave the night is complete on

  // --- The world ----------------------------------------------------------------
  // One ring on the floor, close in. A set of them every 4m out to the arena did
  // not earn its keep - four faint circles read as pattern rather than as scale -
  // and one at arm's length does: it is the distance at which a ghost has become
  // your problem. White, because it is the only thing on the floor that is not a
  // rainbow, and its width is a fraction of its radius rather than a number of
  // metres so perspective cannot thin it to nothing.
  _RINGC: [255, 255, 255],
  _RING: [4, 0.02, 0.6],    // radius in metres, width as a fraction of it, alpha
  // A second circle outside it, as a MULTIPLE of the first radius so the two
  // cannot drift apart when either is tuned, then its own width and alpha.
  _RING2: [1.26, 0.0159, 0.6],
  // And the crown between them: how many triangles, and their alpha. Their bases
  // meet corner to corner on the inner circle and their apexes touch the outer
  // one, so the gaps they leave are themselves triangles pointing inward - the
  // band reads as one zigzag rather than as a row of separate spikes. 32 against
  // a 4m ring puts the base at 0.80m under a 0.90m rise, which is a spike rather
  // than a bump. Dimmer than either circle, so the circles stay the shape and
  // this stays the texture.
  _RINGT: [32, 0.28],
  // The ring breathes: radians a second, and how much of its alpha the swing is
  // worth. Drawn additively, so brightening reads as a glow rather than as the
  // shape changing. Slow on purpose - 1.6 rad/s is a four-second breath, and
  // anything faster reads as a warning rather than as something merely alive.
  _RINGP: [1.6, 0.35],
  // Stars sit at a fixed bearing and height on a far cylinder, so they go through
  // the same projection as the floor and swing with the view instead of being
  // painted on the glass. Anything behind you culls itself.
  // The last number is how much of that alpha survives at wave 1: an early
  // evening sky washes most of them out, and full dark brings them all up.
  _STAR: [70, 60, 0.03, 0.75, 0.5, 0.25],
  _STARS: 2.8,        // and how big, in pixels

  // --- The puppet (DESIGN.md 6) ---------------------------------------------
  // The mesh is the unicorn head and neck from the previous game, recovered from
  // git rather than redrawn: it was tuned over many rounds in a purpose-built
  // editor, and none of that work is invalidated by the genre change. Only the
  // body, legs and tail are gone - a puppet is a head and a neck.
  // Pose solved against four things at once rather than set by eye: the horn has
  // to point where the shots go, the neck's arm opening has to sit below the
  // frame so there is no hole to see into, the silhouette has to reach the right
  // side, and half the screen height has to be VISIBLE - measuring the whole
  // bounding box once scored a buried puppet at 60% tall.
  // The sprite's pose. Fractions of the screen height, like everything else in
  // the HUD, so it lands in the same place at any resolution; _UY is measured up
  // from the BOTTOM, because the animal hangs off the bottom-right corner and
  // that is the edge it should stay welded to.
  // The pose, set by the user in tools/unicorn-2d.html against the running game
  // at their own resolution. Read straight off that editor - no conversion and
  // no assumed screen height, which the two before this were built on and were
  // wrong about.
  //
  // All three are fractions of the screen HEIGHT, and x is measured from the
  // CENTRE. The 3D puppet did the same - it was placed in camera space, which
  // projects as W/2 plus something scaled by H - and measuring from the left
  // edge instead is what made the animal walk: keep the width and take height
  // away, as docking a console does, and it slid from 71% across the frame to
  // 38%. The crosshair never followed it, because that is solved against the
  // width, so the horn drifted away from where the shots were going.
  //
  // 0.0785 is the left-anchored 1.240 converted at the window the pose was
  // actually tuned at, 1280x551. The editor did that arithmetic against the real
  // window rather than me guessing the aspect ratio, which had moved the pose
  // twice before.
  _US: 0.0050,         // grid units to pixels
  _UX: 0.0800,         // the horn tip, right of the screen's CENTRE
  _UY: 0.4000,          // and up from the bottom
  _UROT: -0.1745,      // radians the sprite is turned, on top of how it is drawn.
                      // -5.00 degrees. Its horn is drawn along -121.50, so the
                      // line it ends up aiming along is -126.50.
  _UEY: 27.00,         // the eye's own centre in grid units, so a blink flattens
                      // it about itself rather than about the model's origin
  _UHA: [0.5930, 0.8052],       // the horn axis, tip to base: the way recoil kicks
  _URC: 0.012,         // and how far it kicks, as a fraction of the height
  // Where the horn is SEEN to point. Stated rather than derived now that the
  // horn is drawn, and left exactly as the solved 3D pose resolved to: the
  // crosshair lands where it always did, and the sprite above was aligned onto
  // it rather than the other way round.
  _AIMY: -0.01534,     // the aim's vertical component. Sideways is solved.
                      // horn's line through the middle of the screen.
                      // sideways, and it was 59px high. The pose is otherwise
                      // yours to set from the view a player
                      // sees; the servo below takes care of the aim, so nothing
                      // here has to be traded against it. The editor reads out
                      // where the neck's opening lands, as a warning, not a rule.

  // Group placement. The table is one row per part, but on a real animal the
  // head, its horn and its eyes move together - nudging the head row alone
  // leaves its own horn behind. These are applied on the way out of the table,
  // so one slider moves everything attached. Step 9 needs exactly these handles
  // anyway: recoil offsets the head group, and a blink flattens the eyes.
                      // pitch, yaw, roll. The pivot is derived from the head row
                      // rather than stored, so a retuned neck keeps the joint.
  // Eyes are discs on the flanks of the head, not rows in the table. They were
  // swept boxes, which at this size reads as a rectangular stud rather than an
  // eye. A ten-sided disc is round enough at a few pixels across and is still
  // made of the hard-edged polygons DESIGN.md 5 asks for - no rounded primitive.
  // Placed against the head rather than in model coordinates, so they stay on it
  // when the head is retuned:
                      // up, how far along the head, how far out as a multiple of
                      // the head's own half-width there, radius, and how far the
                      // disc stands proud
  _GOLD: [255, 214, 10],        // the horn. The brightest single thing on screen.
  // The mane is placed as ONE thing: where its middle sits along the neck and how
  // much of the neck it covers. It used to be a first position and a last one,
  // which meant moving the mane took two sliders that had to be moved by the same
  // amount in the same direction, and any slip re-spread it instead.
  // The mane sits ON the top face of the neck and nowhere else. The old one was
  // swept from a point 60% of the way out from the neck's axis - inside the neck,
  // not on it - along a crest direction computed from the raw table row rather
  // than the posed one. Rebuilt: every tuft is rooted exactly on the surface the
  // neck actually has, at the width it actually has there.
                      // back along the neck; straight up reads as a fin.

  // The rainbow IS the cooldown readout (DESIGN.md 6): fully coloured means the
  // bind is ready, washed out means it is recharging, and there is no bar to
  // draw anywhere. DESIGN.md put that on a casting arm; with the arm gone and
  // the unicorn casting instead, the rainbow it runs on is the MANE.
  _SAT0: 0.12,         // how much colour is left at the moment of casting

  // --- The bind (DESIGN.md 6) ------------------------------------------------
  // Centred on the player, not in front of them. Hold to charge, release to cast
  // at whatever radius you have grown.
  _BINDCHG: 3,         // seconds to a full charge. It fires ITSELF at that point -
                      // holding longer buys nothing, so the charge is a window,
                      // not a resource you can sit on.
  _BINDCD: 9,          // seconds of cooldown a full-strength cast costs. An upgrade
                      // card. You cannot begin a new charge while any is owed.
  _BINDR: 9,           // the biggest radius a full charge buys, metres. A card.
  _BINDDUR: 3,         // how long a caught ghost is held. A card.
  // Everything above 2.6 came out of a SIMULATED keyboard player, which turned
  // out not to be a model of a human one: the simulation put 3.5 at a median of
  // 28 waves and 2.04 at 8, so 3.14 was set from the gesture - half a turn in a
  // second - and left there. Played, that is too fast to land on anything.
  //
  // Why the keyboard needs to be slower than the number alone suggests: holding
  // a key sweeps 3 degrees a frame at 3.14, and the aim assist can only answer
  // with 0.2 to 0.9 of a degree, so while a key is down the assist has under a
  // quarter of the authority and cannot hold you on a ghost. A mouse stops, and
  // then the assist has all of it - which is why the mouse felt right at every
  // one of these values and the keyboard did not.
  _KTURN: 2.6,         // radians a second of keyboard yaw. DESIGN.md 12 calls turn
                      // speed the primary difficulty knob, so this is the same
                      // knob TURN is, in the units a key can be held in. Half a
                      // turn in 1.21s, a full one in 2.42s.
  _KPITCH: 1.08,       // and its own rate for pitch, because that range is only
                      // 63 degrees end to end - one rate for both put the whole
                      // of it half a second apart.
  _ARM: 0.3,           // seconds of holding still before the charge begins. The
                      // start of every press is free for turning, so a drag never
                      // charges by accident.
  _ARMPX: 8,           // pixels from where the press landed that make it a turn and
                      // nothing else. Measured as distance from that point, not
                      // distance travelled: a hand shaking in place covers a lot
                      // of the second but goes nowhere, and only going somewhere
                      // means you meant to turn.
  _BINDSEG: 44,        // segments in a drawn circle
  _EYE: 1.6,           // how high the eye is above the ground the ring lies on
  // The charge is the rainbow lying on the ground, pulsing outward.
  _BINDBAND: 10,       // filled bands it is drawn as, all the same width, edge to
                      // edge - so the disc is covered rather than ringed
  _BINDA: 0.55,        // the brightest a band gets
  _RIMW: 0.35,         // width of the circle marking where the wave will end, metres
  _RIMA: 0.85,         // and its brightness at the moment it fires
  _RIMFI: 0.35,        // seconds it fades in over. Hung on the charge rather than
                      // on the arming window: the fade is worth having, but only
                      // once there is a charge to announce.
  _RIMC: [34, 201, 255],        // cyan - the rainbow's own, so it stays in palette
  _BINDWAV: 2.2,       // wave crests across the radius
  _BINDPUL: 0.9,       // crests per second, travelling outward
  // And the cast is a wall of it, sweeping out to the radius it caught.
  _WALLDUR: 0.45,      // seconds the wall lives
  _WALLH: 2.4,         // how tall ONE rainbow stands, metres
  _WALLREP: 2,         // how many times it repeats up the wall, so the whole thing
                      // is WALLH * WALLREP tall
  _WALLA: 0.9,         // its brightness at the moment of the cast
  _EYERB: 9,           // rainbow colours a second the eyes run while charging

  // --- Outline ---------------------------------------------------------------
  // A dark edge on the neck and head only. They are one colour meeting one
  // colour, so without it the joint between them is invisible; the horn, eyes and
  // mane already separate themselves by being a different colour entirely.

  // --- Animation (DESIGN.md 6) ----------------------------------------------
                      // Measured on screen: 0.1 moves the horn tip 5px, 0.3 moves
                      // it 16px, 0.6 moves it 35px.
  _RECT: 0.16,         // and the seconds it takes to ease back out
  _BLINKD: 0.11,       // how long a blink lasts
  _BLINK0: 2,          // and the window between them, seconds. Randomised, because
  _BLINK1: 5,          // a blink on a fixed timer reads as a machine.
  _BLINKS: 0.05,       // how far the eye closes: its own height, times this

  // --- Horns (DESIGN.md 6: travel time, not hitscan) ------------------------
  _FIRE: 1,            // seconds between shots at fire rate level 1. The puppet
                      // fires on its own at this cadence - the trigger is not a
                      // trigger. DESIGN.md 9 makes fire rate an upgrade card, so
                      // this is the slowest the gun ever is, and the pointer is
                      // left free for aiming and, at step 5, the bind.
  _HSPD: 26,           // metres per second
  _HLIFE: 1.2,         // seconds before it expires
  _HHIT: 0.5,          // metres, collision radius against a ghost centre
  _HW: 0.035,          // the flying horn's own radius at its base
  _HL: 0.3,            // and its length, metres
  _HGR: 0.34,          // the glow: its radius in METRES, so it shrinks with distance
                      // like everything else rather than being a fixed screen blob.
                      // A shade longer than the horn, so it haloes rather than
                      // swallows it
  _HGA: 0.55,          // and its alpha at the centre. Additive over the cone's own
                      // full gold, so the core saturates to a near-white point and
                      // the falloff stays gold
  _HN: 7,              // sides on it. It is a cone - a horn is round - and a box
                      // swept to a point is a pyramid, which is what it was.
  // The convergence range is EASED rather than switched. The crosshair sits where
  // the shots meet, and the muzzle is over a metre off the camera axis - so the
  // screen position depends on the RANGE, and every time that range changed in one
  // frame the crosshair flicked. Measured: 93px in a single frame when a ghost
  // reaches you and the range snaps back to CONV, 14px when one crosses the line,
  // and a flip back and forth when two sit at similar bearings and different
  // depths. Easing turns all three into a slide.
  // And it never converges closer than this. The muzzle is at MUZZ, so a ghost at
  // contact put the convergence point barely past it, where a centimetre of range
  // is a dozen pixels of screen - which is why easing alone still left a 15px step
  // when one reached you. Point blank does not need a convergence anyway.
  _CONVMIN: 2.5,       // metres
  _CONVS: 6,           // how much of the way to the new range it moves a second
  _CONV: 9,            // metres. Where a shot goes when nothing is under the
                      // crosshair. The muzzle sits over a metre off the camera
                      // axis - a worn puppet has to sit where a hand is - so a
                      // shot on a fixed direction crosses the crosshair's line at
                      // exactly one range. It aims at the RANGE of whatever is
                      // under the crosshair instead, and this is the fallback.

                      // The puppet itself does not move to aim. It used to turn

                      // in front of the eye - so a ghost closer than that could
                      // not be shot AT ALL, and ghosts reach you at 1.1m. The
                      // shot starts from the point at THIS depth that projects
                      // exactly where the tip does. Simply scaling the tip toward
                      // the eye does not do that: s = F/(F+z) is a fake
                      // perspective, not a pinhole, so points on a ray through the
                      // origin do NOT share a projection - measured, that put the

  //   frequency, wisps, colour, eye shape, horn, mouth, eye tilt, mouth curve,
  //   mouth height, mouth drop, horn spread, crown horn, solid
  // Eye shape 0 is a plain round void; 1 is the scared one - a dome over a lower
  // edge that curves up INTO the eye. Horn is how far a spike stands above the
  // dome, as a fraction of the half width, and 0 is no horn at all. Horn spread
  // is where those horns sit, measured from the crown: 0 puts ONE there, up to 1
  // puts TWO that far around the dome, and PAST 1 puts them down the straight
  // sides instead - 1.35 is a third of the way down, where they read as arms.
  // Crown horn is a second one at the very top, independent of the pair, so a
  // ghost can wear both. Mouth is its
  // half width as a fraction of the ghost's radius, and 0 is no mouth.
  //
  // Solid turns a ghost from additive to opaque, and it has to be a switch rather
  // than just a dark colour: every other ghost is drawn under lighter, and black
  // ADDS NOTHING - a black ghost there is not dark, it is invisible. A solid one
  // is filled normally and its face is painted on in SOLIDF rather than cut out
  // of it as a hole.
  //
  // Eye tilt shears the eye so its outer end rides up and its inner end drops -
  // an angry brow, and the same shape sheared rather than a second shape. Mouth
  // curve is that mouth's own EYEBOW: 1 is a straight top, over 1 curves it DOWN
  // into the mouth, which with the dome already below gives both edges bending
  // the same way.
  //
  // Mouth height is a multiple of that mouth's half width, and a NEGATIVE one
  // turns the whole shape over - dome up, curved edge along the bottom. Mouth
  // drop is where its flat edge sits below the middle. Both are per type because
  // a flipped mouth grows the other way: one shared drop would put the Hulk's

// space: it is worn, not placed in the world.
//
// The table is the old rig's, verbatim. Each row is a swept box from one point to
// another with half-extents at each end, then a material:
//   [ax, ay, az,  bx, by, bz,  w0, h0,  w1, h1,  material]
// Model space is the rig's own: +y UP, the animal facing +z. The new world is
// y-down, so T flips y.
//
// One number IS changed from the recovered table: the neck ran from x=.025 to
// x=.075 while the head, horn and both eyes sit on x=.1. The old game viewed the
// animal side-on, where a lateral offset is a depth offset and invisible. Worn on
// an arm and seen from behind, it put the whole neck - and the mane that reads its
// position out of this row - down one side of the head. The neck is on the
// sagittal plane now.
//
// The horn is re-angled for the same class of reason. On the side-on animal it
// rose 74 degrees from the muzzle line, which is what a unicorn horn does when it
// is scenery. Here it is the barrel: it has to point where the shots go, and
// pitching the whole puppet 66 degrees to achieve that buried the head below the
// frame. It now leaves the forehead at 15 degrees, the same length as before.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

// aims reads the table through this, so the head, horn and eyes cannot drift
// apart, and the horn a shot leaves along is the horn that gets drawn.
// The head group's rotation, applied to a direction. Kept separate from the point
// version so the eyes can push out along the head's rotated flank instead of along
// model x, which is where they would stay if only positions were rotated.
// And to a point: scaled and rotated about the joint, then moved.

// The neck's base: where the forearm enters, and so what the puppet pivots about.

// Model space into camera space. A rigid placement plus a uniform scale, so
// normals stay normals and push() can go on deriving them from the geometry.

// Charging, the eyes and the horn run the rainbow. It eases in over the charge,
